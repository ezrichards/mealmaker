# mealmaker
A simple web app built with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) to manage recipes & grocery lists.

This project stack and structure is based off of [YelpCamp](https://github.com/Colt/YelpCamp/), a project from an online course I did many years back.

This is a work in progress. Styles are still being improved as well as "Grocery List" functionality.

## Potential Improvements
There are a few different ways this application could be improved in the future.
- "Recipe finder from owned ingredients" feature: given owned ingredients, see what recipes "match" closely.
- "Add meal to grocery list" feature: given a Recipe schema's ingredients, add them all to a grocery list.
- Receipt scanner feature: scan receipt to load data (for owned ingredients idea above)
